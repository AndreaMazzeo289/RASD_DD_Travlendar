\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
The application must require to the user different permissions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Accesso to the calendar;
	\item Get hit position with GPS;
	\item Access to device storage.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The application, at the moment, runs only on Android 4.0.3 version or newer. \\
The device needs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Internet connection;
	\item GPS;
	\item Space for save application in memory.
\end{itemize}
Actual devices on the market satisfy all these requirements.
\subsection{Software system attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system must guarantee a 24/7 service.
\subsubsection{Availability}
The system requires a GPS service and internet connection in order to work properly. When the connection is down the system works with the last updated information available in the device memory. 
\subsubsection{Security}
The application must provide secure storage for all sensitive data inserted by the user. One way to achieve it is the use of cryptographical techniques.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The application now is in beta version, this means that can present some bugs. Certainly, the application will be periodically upgraded and each release allow to remove known bugs and add more functionality.
Periodically all information that are stored inside the application must be backed up, in order to reduce danger of lost information in case of malfunction of the application.
\subsubsection{Portability}
Now the application has been developed only for android device (more specifically only for android version 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich or newer versions).
Further developments will lead this application also in iOS devices.
Another possible development is the creation of a web site that is synchronized with application, and allow to the user to control their appointment also on desktop pc and laptop.
