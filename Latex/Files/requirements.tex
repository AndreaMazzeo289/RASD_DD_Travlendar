\subsection{Design constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
The application must require to the user different permissions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Access to the calendar;
	\item Get hit position with GPS;
	\item Access to device storage.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The application, at the moment, runs only on Android 4.0.3 version or newer. \\
The device needs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Internet connection;
	\item GPS;
	\item Space for save application in memory.
\end{itemize}
Actual devices on the market satisfy all these requirements.
\subsection{Software system attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system must guarantee a 24/7 service.
\subsubsection{Availability}
The system requires a GPS service and internet connection in order to work properly. When the connection is down the system works with the last updated information available in the device memory.  
\subsubsection{Security}
The application must provide secure storage for all sensitive data inserted by the user. One way to achieve it is the use of cryptographical techniques.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The application will be released in beta version, meaning that it may eventually have some bugs. The application will be periodically upgraded and each release will be focus on solving detected problems.
Periodically all information stored in the application must be backed up, in order to reduce the possibility of losing information in case of malfunctions.
\subsubsection{Portability}
The application will be released only for Android smartphones (more specifically only for Android version 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich or later).\\
Future plan is to lead the software also on iOS devices.
